To package this as an MVP:
- A single command to start the local server (starts the API & kernel).
- Support only a single notebook at a time.
- Can load a notebook file, edit/run, and download the proto back.

UI building priorities:
- include cell code & output in node data.
- update sidebar cell based on select
- Edit the cell code
